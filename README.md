=====================

The [Bootflat](http://bootflat.github.io/) UI kit for [Sketch 3](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

![Preview Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teracy-official/bootflat-ui-kit.sketch/develop/img/bootflat-preview.png)

We've created a Sketch version of Bootflat framework and added some missing elements which are not included in the [UI KIT PSD](http://bootflat.github.io/free-psd.html).

To use, simply download the *Download ZIP* button on the right sidebar, unzip and open the .sketch file. It's recommended to place this file somewhere safe, and duplicate it when you need to create your own layout.

***Sketch 3.1+ is required***
